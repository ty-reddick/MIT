Class & Methods Simulations
Person -> MITPerson(We created an id number) -> Undegad or Grad -> Couse list(a list of students in class)

Yield is a generator(a lil like return but a geneator is a function that emembers the point in the function body where it last returned plus all of the local variables)

How do we build computational models to solve problems
Analytic Models - lets you pedict behaviour given some initioal coonditions and some parameters (Mathematics function)

Similation methods - Sometimes we have systems that are not mathematical tractable(Weather forecasting)
				   - Successivlly refining series of similations
				   - Useful to abstact intemediate esults
				   - Computes

Simulation - Build a model that 1) Gives useful info about behavior of 									   a system
								2) Gives me an Approximation to reality
								3) simulation models ae descriptive not	   prescriptive
